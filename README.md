# Training-a-Five-Layer-Neural-Network
In this project, we explored and analyzed a dataset to develop models for classification tasks, focusing on examining the distribution and balance of the dataset.  We implemented a logistic regression and a five-layer neural network using Keras, with logistic and softmax activation functions for the hidden and output layers.
