# Training-a-Five-Layer-Neural-Network
In this project, we explored and analyzed a dataset to develop models for classification tasks, focusing on examining the distribution and balance of the dataset. Initially, we assessed the dataset size and its division into training, testing, and validation sets. We then delved into understanding the distribution of various classes within the dataset, highlighting any imbalance through visual plots. Recognizing the challenges posed by an unbalanced dataset, we investigated and identified effective techniques to address these issues.

Our analysis included implementing logistic regression and a five-layer neural network using Keras, with logistic and softmax activation functions for the hidden and output layers, respectively. We rigorously evaluated these models across several metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, F1 score, and confusion matrices, for both training and testing phases. The comprehensive evaluation revealed that the neural network model, with its layered architecture and activation functions, provided superior performance in comparison to logistic regression, leading us to conclude that neural networks are more effective for this specific dataset and task.
